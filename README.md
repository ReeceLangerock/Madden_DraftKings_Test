# Madden_DraftKings_Test

Why are there no commits? I didnâ€™t discover the usefulness of github until months after this project was set aside. I wanted to include it for posterity and to show basic knowledge of Java programming. 

The goal of this project was to create a Draftkings.com analog in Java. It is largely unfinished, as it was while working on this project that I made the decision to put all of my efforts into web development. incomplete as it is this project is my largest in Java, and was my first attempt at JavaFX for the GUI, and creating and using web connections for database and user authentication.
